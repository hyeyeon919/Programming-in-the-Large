/**
 * Special Runtime exception
 * Note that this is a Runtime (unchecked exception) which is unlike our normal
 * `extends Exception` as we want to be able to add this to a method
 * without needing to have it in a method signature.
 * The UnsupportedActionException class is a type of runtime exception (unchecked exception)
 * that is used to indicate that an unsupported action or operation was attempted.
 * <p>
 * This class extends the base RuntimeException class
 * in order to provide custom error handling for situations where a method needs to throw an exception,
 * but the exception does not need to be included in the method signature.
 * <p>
 * This class is designed to be used in situations
 * where an action or operation is attempted but is not supported by the current state
 * or configuration of the system.
 * By throwing an instance of this exception,
 * the developer can signal to the calling code that the requested action cannot be performed.
 * <p>
 * The constructors for this class allow for the creation of custom error messages
 * and the inclusion of additional information about the cause of the error, if desired.
